# InventoryTracker Android app

## About

InventoryTracker App is an Android app, which uses Firebase's Functions, Cloud Storage and Database
to perform simple inventory management/warehouse tasks.

(Here)[https://github.com/xBlaz3kx/InventoryTracker-FirebaseFunctions] is the Firebase Functions
implementation that goes with this app.

The app is deprecated and is by no means ready for production use. It was used to learn about
Android native development with Firebase.

## Lessons learned:

1. Make an actual plan. 
2. Use Kotlin or Dart instead of Java since they reduce dev time.
3. Use proper software design patterns.
4. Instead of listening to events on the database and implementing logic there, use HTTP REST API
   instead.
5. Use conventions and other standards.
